\title{Get the names of a data structure. This attempts to 
create some polymorphism around lists, vectors, and data.frames}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Any indexable data structure}
}
\value{
Returns the names for a data structure.
}
\description{
This function gets the useful names of a data structure. This attempts to 
create some polymorphism around lists, vectors, and data.frames.
}
\section{Usage}{

anynames(data)
}

\section{Details}{

Depending on the type of structure utilized in code, one needs to 
call either names or \code{colnames} to get information related to 
the data sets within the structure. The use of two separate functions 
can cause errors and slows development time as data structures 
passed from intermediate functions may change over time,
resulting in a broken interface.

By providing a thin layer over underlying accessors, 
this function attempts to expedite development and add a 
bit of polymorphism to the semantics of names.
The explicit assumption is that data sets in 
two dimensional structures are organized by column, 
as this is compatible with time-series objects such as
zoo and xts.

\examples{
m <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), ncol=2)
anynames(m) <- c('d','e')
anynames(m)

v <- c(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5)
anynames(v)

l <- list(a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4,e=5)
anynames(l)

df <- data.frame(a=1:10, b=1:10,c=1:10,d=1:10,e=1:10)
anynames(df)
