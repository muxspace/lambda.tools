\title{Pad a vector with some default value}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector to pad}

\item{head}{The amount to prepend}

\item{tail}{The amount to append}

\item{default}{The value to use for the pad}
}
\value{
A padded sequence
}
\description{
This function pads a vector with default values as a way to coerce the
value to some predetermined length.
}
\section{Usage}{

pad(x, head, tail=0, default=NA)
}

\section{Details}{

It is common for sequence operations to return a sequence that is
shorter than the original sequence. This phenomenon can be
annoying when binding the output with the input in a regular
data structure like a matrix or data.frame. This function prepends
or appends a specified value to a data structure to ensure that the
length of the data structure is compatible with another data structure.

\examples{
# A moving average results in n - window + 1 results, so pad at the
# head to get a vector of length 50
x <- abs(rnorm(50))
m <- maprange(x, 10, mean)
pad(m, 9) 

# Pad at the end instead of the beginning. Note that the head must
# explicitly be set to 0
pad(m, 0, 9)

# Pad on both sides
pad(m, 4, 5) 

# Use a different default value
pad(m, 9, default=0)
