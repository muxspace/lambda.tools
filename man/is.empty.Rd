\title{Check whether data is bad or empty}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object containing the data to test}
}
\value{
Logical values that indicate whether the test was successful 
or not. For matrices and data.frames, a matrix of logical values 
will be returned.
}
\description{
These functions quickly test whether data within an object has 
bad values or if the object is defined (i.e. not null) but has no data.
}
\section{Usage}{

is.empty(x) %::% a : logical
is.empty(x)

is.bad(x)
}

\section{Details}{

Depending on the type of an object, knowing whether an object contains a
valid value or not is different. These functions unify the interfaces across
different data types quickly indicating whether an object contains bad
values and also whether an object has a value set.

For example, a data.frame may be initialized with no data. This results in
an object that is non-null but also unusable. Instead of checking whether
something is both non-null and has positive length, just check is.bad().

If you know that an object is non-null, then you can call is.empty() which
is a shortcut for checking the length of an object.

a <- data.frame(a=NULL, b=NULL)
is.bad(a)

b <- list(a=1:3, b=NULL, c=NA, d='foo')
is.bad(b)

c <- list()
is.empty(c)
